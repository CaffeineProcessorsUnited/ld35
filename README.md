#Fluffy Shape Racer

##The Game
Hello there and welcome to our submission for the 35. Ludum Dare!

This game was inspired mainly by pink fluffy unicorns while being highly
encaffeinated and served with a lot of other types of food that somehow happen
to start with the letter c...

To put it simple (not that it's even getting complicated...) You have to fit shapes
in the front to the cut out shapes on the wall to be able to pass through it.

The shapes are moving faster and faster, so be quick!
To select which shape to change press the accordingly positioned arrow key then
select the desired shape by pressing the according WASD key or the space bar.
For ease of learning these keys are shown on screen.

In case you already got the shapes right and no time to chase for the wall
use your magical teleportation powers by pressing the n key.

Do you want a challenge? Quick observation and reactions? Then hardcore mode is just
right for you. You start with increased speed and disabled shape hints.
