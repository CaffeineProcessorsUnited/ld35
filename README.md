#Fluffy Shape Racer

##The Game
Hello There and Welcome to our submission for the 35. Ludum Dare!

This game was inspired mainly by pink fluffy unicorns while being highly
encaffeinated and served with a lot of other types of food that somehow happen
to start with the letter c...

To put it simple (not that it's even getting complicated...) You have to fit the
shapes in the front to the cut out shapes on the wall to be able to pass through it.
The shapes are moving faster and faster, so be quick!
To select which shape to change, press the accordingly positioned arrow key, and
to select the desired shape press the according WASD key or the space bar.
The keys are shown on the screen. To be teleported right in front of the wall, press n,
in case you already got the shapes right and want to pass through it right away! In the
hardcore mode, the required shaped won't be displayed on top of the screen.
